                <p>Hello! My name is Shawn Jensen, I am a red headed Canadian from Lethbridge Alberta. I‚Äôm a father of two children, an 8-year-old daughter, and a 3-year-old son.  My wife and I have been married for over 15 years.   I have a diploma in Business Administration from Lethbridge College.  I am currently employed with a provincial crown corporation called Agriculture Financial Service Center. I analyze business plans and financial statements to assess the risk of farm operations for lending purposes, specializing in start up farm operations.  I wanted an exciting new challenge and enrolled in the programming and web development certificate with BYU Idaho online.  I am excited for the new skills I will develop as I work through this program.  I am not currently looking to change my career, but this class will help me develop better skills that I will be able to use in my current position or any potential future advances or position changes. </p>
